How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - Incorporating user needs is important to create a program that will satisfy user needs and keep them on the platform. In order to do this, I can take user feedback via surveys or interviews and turn them into user stories. 
    These become small descriptions of what users want and ways that we can verify the results, which can be utilized by the team to prioritize and produce backlog items.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - Approaching development with an open mindset is important for agile and by extension all development. This allows for new ideas to be created and pursued as well as opens up new perspectives on how to overcome challenges.
    This can be achieved through process such as daily scrum meets where you work closely with your team and brainstorm about the tasks at hand and any challenges. This allows you to work with the team, discover impediments, and then work to overcome them.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  -A good team member is one who is open to constructive discussion and genuinely wants to see the product succeed. The desire to create a successfull product drives the team to higher development goals and the openness to discussion
   allows them to reflect upon the work done so far and collaborate with the team to find the most efficient way forward.
